# MEGABOT Discord Bot (Serverless)

![MEGACORD LOGO](/images/thumbnail.gif)

MEGABOT is a fully customized Discord bot, now rewritten in **TypeScript** and deployed on AWS Lambda using [SST](https://sst.dev) (serverless, scalable, and cost-effective). All core features from the original Python version are preserved, but now with modern serverless architecture.
