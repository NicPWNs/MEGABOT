# MEGABOT Discord Bot

![MEGACORD LOGO](/thumbnail.gif)

Another Discord bot for learning and fun. Using ~~discord.py~~ `pycord` to practice CI/CD with [GitHub actions](https://github.com/NicPWNs/MEGABOT/actions) and EC2. Not serverless, unfortunately. ðŸ˜ž

> Some commands use my own Python package: [random-unicode-emoji](https://github.com/NicPWNs/random_unicode_emoji)
> Originally based off of my first bot: [BlessThisMess](https://github.com/NicPWNs/Discord-BTM-Bot)
